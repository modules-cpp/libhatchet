```

## v1.50.3 2026-07-22

```text
- Optimized console code size. Removed the use of virtual and cut code duplication.
- Optimized test script job control. `testall.sh` runs 2x faster.
- Test scripts handle flags more consistently.
- `listsymbols.sh` now uses straight python instead of a mix of commands.
- Drop `hxfile::scan` because it was bloated and dogy. Use the console or roll your own.

```

## v1.49.5 2026-07-15

- Add `hxhandle_map`. Maps 64-bits to a dense array of T, allowing for high frequency cache coherent iteration.
- Fix a few names in the test suite.
- Rename the method `set_table_size_bits` to `set_size_bits`.
- Build scripts use  `HX_.*_` namespace. Legal compiler args do not have the trailing underscore.

```

## v1.47.4 2026-07-10

```text

- Added `hxhash_table::replace`.
- Compacted the test suite so that tests for the same function go in the same test.

```

## v1.22.0 2026-04-12

```text
This is an "orphaned" branch that drops the 7 year git history of this project. There was obsolete image data and it was getting bloated.

The old history is here:  https://github.com/whatchamacallem/hatchling-platform
```

## v3.40.0 2026-03-19

```text
This is the last release of the Hatchling Platform.

It contains a final usability pass on the container node base classes.

Hatchling Platform has been renamed libhatchet and moved to: https://github.com/whatchamacallem/libhatchet
```

## v3.38.0 2026-03-15

```text
Adds hxrbtree. Provides intrusive set, map, multiset and multimap.

Adds hxlist. Provides an intrusive linked list.
```

## v3.36.0 2026-03-14

```text
Significant additions are `hxbitset`, `hxdeque` and an example program.

The `CLAUDE.md` file is starting to mature however it still generates overly complex code.

`.clang-tidy` is being enforced everywhere now.

The `hxfile::read` now requires the size of the destination buffer in keeping with modern security practices.
```
